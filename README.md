# WildfireDetection
This project is based on our study of the existing publications which focused on wildfire prediction using traditional approaches and coming up with an advanced Machine Learning model to detect wildfire accurately along with its severity. Our project uses 4 ML models namely CNN and Advanced CNN which are used to deal with satellite images and Random Forest and Decision Tree Regressor which are used for weather data in the form of CSV. Data is preprocessed and fed to these models. All the models are then integrated together to give better and accurate results considering all the parameters. For demonstration of our project, we have created a website wherein user can enter data and get fire prediction as Fire, smoke or no fire on the desired image!
